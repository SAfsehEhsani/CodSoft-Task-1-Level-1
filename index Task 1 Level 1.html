                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Dinosaurs were a group of reptiles that lived on Earth for over 245 million years and were the dominant land animals for more than 100 million years.Dinosaurs came in many shapes and sizes, from the giant Spinosaurus to the chicken-sized Microraptor, and were able to survive in a variety of ecosystems. They were ancestrally bipedal, but many extinct groups included quadrupedal species, and some were able to shift between these stances. Dinosaurs became extinct about 65.5 million years ago.

                        <p>Dinosaur fossils have been found on all seven continents. All non-avian dinosaurs went extinct about 66 million years ago. There are roughly 700 known species of extinct dinosaurs. Modern birds are a kind of dinosaur because they share a common ancestor with non-avian dinosaurs.</p>

                        <p>The exact nature of this catastrophic event is still open to scientific debate. Evidence suggests an asteroid impact was the main culprit. Volcanic eruptions that caused large-scale climate change may also have been involved, together with more gradual changes to Earth's climate that happened over millions of years.</p>

                            In the mid-1600s, a fossil bone was acquired by Dr Robert Plot, the first keeper of Oxford's Ashmolean Museum. He noted that it looked almost exactly like the lower part of a human femur.</p>
